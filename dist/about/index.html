                     <h2>The Corporation</h2>

                    <p>SalesEdge develops an interest in our clients' products and / or services
                        at the senior executive level of their primary target market.</p>
                    <p>With extensive experience in sales and business relationships, professional
                        staff employ our unique process to set viable and valuable initial sales
                        meetings for companies in a variety of business sectors.</p>
                    <p>As your strategic partner, SalesEdge delivers a positive, professional
                        image of your firm.</p>
                     <h2>Services</h2>

                    <p>SalesEdge introduces your products and services to interested executives
                        in your key prospective markets. The right kind of sales meetings result
                        in increased sales for your firm.</p>
                    <p>Our experienced professionals know how to get through to executives at
                        prospective clients. When they do, a carefully worded script explains the
                        value proposition and interested executives will ask for a meeting with
                        a representative from your firm. Our meeting brokers do not sell meetings,
                        because we clearly understand that you don't want your representatives
                        traveling to meetings that have been pushed upon the prospect. We only
                        schedule meetings with interested executives who feel that you may be able
                        to solve a problem, add value or save them money. We do not attempt to
                        qualify over the phone because our meeting brokers are not experts in your
                        business. If asked a question, we will say: "I have written your question
                        down and it will be addressed at the meeting". In addition, we collect
                        'requests for information' from interested parties and fulfill them with
                        your materials or pass them on to your staff.</p>
                    <p>So; for launching a new product / service, for gaining entry to a new
                        market, or to shorten your sales cycle and drive revenue – think SalesEdge.</p>
                     <h2>The Process</h2>

                    <p>You provide the prospect criteria and approve the cold-call database.
                        The database, which you retain, goes through a rigorous 3 step development
                        process to ensure accuracy. We collaborate on the development of the brief
                        introductory script and you approve it. You provide us with current meeting
                        calendars for your participating sales professionals, meeting frequency
                        guidelines, and any travel considerations. We set the meetings, confirm
                        the meetings via e-mail, and later reconfirm via telephone. Keeping you,
                        our client, appraised at all times.</p>
                     <h2>Projects</h2>

                    <p>Over the years SalesEdge has contributed to positive sales gains for domestic
                        and international corporations. Clients include BDO Dunwoody, Borland,
                        Cognos, Computer Associates, Dell, Deloitte, Ernst &amp; Young, Hewlett
                        Packard, Oracle, Rexall, SAS, and Sun Microsystems.</p>
                     <h2>The Case for Introductory Services</h2>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sales people do not cold-call on a regular basis because they dislike
                            it.</li>
                        <li>Sales people who meet regularly with interested senior executives at prospective
                            companies sell more.</li>
                        <li>Real sales producers are hard to find. Retain them and increase their
                            success rate with services from SalesEdge.</li>
                    </ul>
